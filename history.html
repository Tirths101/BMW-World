                    <h3>Origins and Founding (1916-1923) <i class="fa-solid fa-person-military-rifle"></i></h3>
                    <p>BMW, short for Bayerische Motoren Werke (Bavarian Motor Works), was founded in 1916 in Munich,
                        Germany. Initially, the company was known as Rapp Motorenwerke, a manufacturer of aircraft
                        engines. However, after World War I, the Treaty of Versailles prohibited German companies from
                        producing aircraft engines, prompting BMW to diversify its production. The company then
                        transitioned into manufacturing motorcycles and automobiles, beginning with the production of
                        its first motorcycle, the BMW R32, in 1923.</p>

                    <h3>Expansion into Automobiles (1928-1939) <i class="fa-solid fa-industry"></i></h3>
                    <p>BMW's entry into the automobile industry began in 1928 when it acquired Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach,
                        a car manufacturing company. This acquisition allowed BMW to produce its first car, the BMW
                        3/15, based on the Austin 7. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its automobile lineup,
                        introducing models like the BMW 328, which became famous for its success in motorsport. By the
                        end of the decade, BMW had established itself as a prominent player in both the motorcycle and
                        automobile industries.</p>

                    <h3>Post-War Challenges and Recovery (1945-1960) <i class="fa-solid fa-peace"></i></h3>
                    <p>After World War II, BMW faced significant challenges as its factories were heavily damaged, and
                        the company was initially banned from producing automobiles. The post-war period was marked by
                        struggles to rebuild and reestablish itself. In 1952, BMW resumed car production with the
                        introduction of the BMW 501, a luxury sedan. Despite financial difficulties during the 1950s,
                        BMW managed to stay afloat, partly due to the success of the BMW Isetta, a small, economical
                        microcar. By the end of the 1950s, the company had regained stability and was on the path to
                        recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Rise to Luxury Brand Status (1960-1980) <i class="fa-solid fa-car-side"></i></h3>
                    <p>The 1960s marked a turning point for BMW as the company shifted its focus toward producing
                        sporty, high-performance vehicles. The introduction of the "New Class" sedans, particularly the
                        BMW 1500 in 1962, was a major success and laid the foundation for BMW's reputation as a luxury
                        brand. The company continued to innovate, launching iconic models such as the BMW 2002, which
                        played a crucial role in establishing BMW's image as a producer of sports sedans. By the 1970s,
                        BMW had firmly positioned itself as a leading luxury car manufacturer.</p>

                    <h3>Global Expansion and Modern Era (1980-Present) <i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i></h3>
                    <p>From the 1980s onward, BMW embarked on a path of global expansion, establishing production plants
                        and subsidiaries around the world. The company's lineup continued to grow, including the
                        introduction of the BMW M series, which became synonymous with high-performance luxury vehicles.
                        In the 1990s and 2000s, BMW further solidified its presence in the premium automotive market by
                        acquiring other brands like Rolls-Royce and MINI. Today, BMW is recognized as one of the world's
                        leading luxury car manufacturers, known for its innovation, engineering excellence, and
                        commitment to sustainability.</p>
