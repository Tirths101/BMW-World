### Bugs

#### Solved bugs

  - Upon deploying my project to GitHub Pages, i encountered an issue where the links to CSS files and images were broken.

  - This was caused by the use of absolute file paths, such as:
  ![Screenshot of absolute file paths](assets/images/Screenshot-incorrect-path.png)

  - To resolve this, I removed the starting **"/workspace/BMW-World/"** from the file paths, allowing the resources to load correctly.

    - The code was successfully validated with no errors when tested using official W3C validator.
